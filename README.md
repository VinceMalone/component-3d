## Prototype Features

- "Elevated" mode (top-right button)
  - Drag to rotate
  - Scroll (with mouse wheel or track pad) to zoom
  - Component labels, shadows, and outlines
  - Setting to control the distance between layers (Z) and components in a layer (X)
  - Toggle visibility of a (single) layer

## Potential Enhancements

- Better "Elevation Visibility" UX
  - Keep other layers _dimmed_
- Tap layer to view it in isolation
- Tap/hover component to view its summary, prop types, or example usage
- Scrolling zooms in on the closest layer until it fills the screen, fades away, and exposes the next layer to scroll
